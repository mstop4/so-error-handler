# Stack Overflow Error Handler

An implementation of this tweet https://twitter.com/divineomega/status/695744177557106688 because of reasons.

Opens a new window/tab in browser that displays Stack Overflow search results for the thrown error.

NOTE: If your browser is configured to open new pages to new windows, its pop-up blocker might prevent the search results from showing up automatically.

## Usage

Run

```
npm install
```

for first-time setup, then run

```
npm start
```

then go to `http://localhost:8080` in your browser
